# dzanga-ele
Collaborative project focused on space use by forest elephants in Dzanga-Sangha.

Collaborators: Margaret Swift, Ivonne Kienast, Stephen Morreale.

**WARNING: This repository is public, but raw data files (especially elephant GPS data) are sensitive and never stored or tracked through GitHub.**

Big questions: ?

Mechanical questions: How can we use intermittent canopy-interrupted data from GPS-collared elephants, in conjunction with a grid of passive acoustic monitoring data, to map space use by African forest elephants (_Loxodonta cyclotis_) in Dzanga-Sangha?

Data: 

1. Passive acoustic monitoring data, YYYY(?)
1. Elephant GPS data (4 hour fixes), 2018-2023
1. Canopy cover raster, 2019 (100m) 
- Citation: Reiner, F., Brandt, M., Tong, X. et al. More than one quarter of Africaâ€™s tree cover is found outside areas previously classified as forest. Nat Commun 14, 2258 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37880-4
- Data located: https://zenodo.org/records/7764460

Output: Create three mapping layers.

1. Map of **positive elephant presence density** using _passive acoustic monitoring_ data.
1. Map of **likely canopy obstruction** of GPS data (high values = high likelihood of ele presence being obscured) using the _canopy cover raster_.
1. Map of **likely elephant locations** using _elephant GPS_ data.










Two levels:

1. the immediate reporting - what we need to provide to the park, understanding where teh elephants are going, and how much time they're spending in D-S and if it's seasonal. How much time are they spending in other areas?
- using with the data of anti-poaching patrols (poacher camps, carcasses found, etc.) to figure out where to protect?
- poaching and gun hunting + people in the forest and causing disturbance, cable traps not targeteing eles but changing their behavior
1. the question of - what resources are the elephants using? and when? How does Steve think about this? The clearings are obviously allowing more fixes to go through --  




Ivonne's big questions

1. Do the elephants stay mostly within the protected region? What drives them to leave, if they do? When are they more likely to leave the Sangha-Ndoki complex? Eles aren't crossing the river in Lobeke NP.
1. Is the high incidence of ele points in clearings because they're there that much, or because that's where the fixes are coming through? 
1. We expect that the core areas of elephant activity would correspond with hotspots of illegal activity
   - we could combine the audio data to correlate gunshot density with areas that elephants don't go


If elephants are using the bais more than other areas (not just bc the GPS is blocked in dense canopy), and we have all those bais in the north, but elephants aren't going there BECAUSE of poaching (measured as density of gunshots, maybe?), could xomeone use that as an argument to expand anti-poaching initiatives or the park boundaries etc?
